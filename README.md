The files in this project are as follows:

project2 questions document contains the questions, links, and overview of the project.

P2WebScrape.ipynb is the file that contains all the work leading up the the final function, which does everything contained in this file.

CraigslistFinalFunction.ipynb is the fucntion that scrapes the data and returns it as a pandas dataframe. 
It's reccomended you use a vpn while running that function, a double vpn if possible.

craigslist_data.csv is the csv file containing all of the final results from my scrape of all 4 new jersey pages. 
there should be over a thousand data points in there already. this is also the data used in my analysis

analysis.ipynb is the file containing my questions and analysis of the data. I included multiple graphs to best explain the results.
